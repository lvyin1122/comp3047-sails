# Project milestone -Sails

Name: Wang Heyu

SID: 17251133

Github account: lvyin1122


### Problems

1. Due to the CRLF/LF issue, this app may not be able to run on platforms other than Windows.

2. The search-related functions are a bit tedious and need further optimization, but it works well with the requirements at the moment.

3. Sometimes an unknown error may occur after choosing `alter` mode when initiating the sails.js. Try drop shall solve this problem.

### Testing

There are 5 users you can choose to log in with as testing cases. All the passwords are 123456.

- `admin`
- `Member1` with 50 coins and some redeemed coupons
- `Member2` with 5000 coins
- `Visitor1`
- `Visitor2`

### Notes

The system is tested to meet all the requirements. If there is any technical defect, please let me know :)

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@2.0.0`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v2.0.0/lib/core-generators/new). -->



<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
